To check your program make sure to follow these instructions: 


-- *CONDITIONALS AND LOOPS*--
Write ¨if-else¨, ¨repeat x times¨ and ¨while¨ instructions in just one code line.

-- *DEFPROC* --
When adding a defproc, write one brace per line. Then, write the instructions block between both braces. Instructions must be written in just one code line. Here is an example:

Example: 
defProc goNorth()
{while can(walk(1,north)){walk(1,north)}}

-- *CODE BLOCKS* --
If you have block of instructions you must write them in one code line.
For instance check: 
{jump (3 ,3) ; putCB (2 ,1)}


ALSO:

Do not press enter between code lines.

  

WARNING!
Otherwise the verification process will fail.
